			The Amazon Purge Checker Reddit Bot, usually just called Purge Bot,
			is a script that scrapes data from
			<a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/top-reviewers">
				Amazon's Top 10,000 Reviewers list
			</a>
			and determines whose reviews were "purged" or reinstated on the
			current day and then posts that information to
			<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGreatAmazonPurge/">Reddit</a>.
			Occasionally Amazon will remove all of a reviewer's reviews; this is
			referred to as "purging." It is usually done when a reviewer breaks
			Amazon's Terms of Service in some way.
		</p>
		<p>
			This script was made in 2016 when Amazon was receiving backlash for
			its influx of incentivized reviews. Its goal was to see if Amazon
			was taking any kind of action against the issue.
